Something awesome arrived in the mail this morning! Steve's nephew Luka Ngata designed and made these cool controller stands for us to take to [PAX Aus](http://aus.paxsite.com/) next month.

They are laser-cut from thin sheets of MDF, and you just fold them into the final shape - very clever piece of design, and they work amazingly well.

Thanks so much Luka! :D
