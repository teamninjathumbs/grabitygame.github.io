## For immediate release

Grabity, the award winning smash brawler with gravity guns, is arriving on Steam on May 31st

Dance the tango of death in a fast-paced, physics-based arena starring combat robots with lethal gravity guns and curiously interchangeable heads

Auckland, 21 May 2018: Team Ninja Thumbs today announced that the award winning Grabity will be available for Windows PC on Steam from May 31st. In this fast-paced, physics-based arena brawler, 2-4 players duke it out using gravity guns to turn nearby objects into lethal projectiles or makeshift shields in intense tactical throw-downs.

‘We love all the classic couch multiplayer games, and we want to deliver that same vibe with online play too,’ explained Moritz, lead artist and co-designer. ‘We’ve worked hard to make sure Grabity’s game modes are fun, the twin-stick controls are fluid and of course that it all plays smoothly online as well as locally.’

‘Plus you can unlock a ton of different heads to bolt on your robot. That’s, um, very important,’ added Steve, programmer for the project.

Requiring both twitch reflexes and a tactical mindset, Grabity demands players outmaneuver and outwit their foes, turning gravity to their advantage, predicting the paths of both projectiles and rivals to secure a brutal hit while snatching their next crate in mid-air. Throughout the frenetic mêlée, the arena evolves kinetically as players smash, grab and loot their surroundings – jostling for the upper hand in a contest of aerial agility, dashing for pickups, hovering momentarily to nail the perfect trajectory and squabbling over the limited environmental ammo.

## Game features

- 2-4 person online multiplayer – or local for maximum couch trash-talk!
- Intuitive twin-stick controls for a fluid play experience that’s simple to learn but hard to master – pick up, play, git gud

- Side-on 2.5D gameplay, fully rendered in 3D with real-time lighting and physics

## About Team Ninja Thumbs

Ninja Thumbs is a small independent game studio based in Auckland, New Zealand. We started off doing game jams, but soon realized that we wanted to take on a bigger project together. Grabity is a side project that quickly grew into a serious undertaking when we realized we had a really fun prototype on our hands!
