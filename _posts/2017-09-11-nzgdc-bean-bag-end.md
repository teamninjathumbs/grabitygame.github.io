We had a great couple of days demoing Grabity at [NZGDC 2017](http://www.nz-gdc.com/), along with a bunch of other amazing upcoming Kiwi titles. Thanks to everyone who gave it a play! :D

Jacqui Brown from TV3's current events show 'The Project' did an great piece on New Zealand's thriving games industry, which you can check out below (links to Facebook):
