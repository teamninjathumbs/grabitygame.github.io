We had a great couple of days demoing Grabity at [NZGDC 2017](http://www.nz-gdc.com/), along with a bunch of other amazing upcoming Kiwi titles. Thanks to everyone who gave it a play! :D

Jacqui Brown from TV3's current events show 'The Project' did an great piece on New Zealand's thriving games industry, which you can check out below (links to Facebook):

A massive congratulations to [Matthew Gatland](https://twitter.com/mgatland) and [Lunar Rooster](http://lunarrooster.com/), who took out the Kiwi Game Starter prizes this year with '[Caves](http://www.matthewgatland.com/games/caves/)' and '[Sky Noon](http://lunarrooster.com/sky-noon/)', respectively.  These games are completely different, but both are amazing and compelling experiences!

All in all it was a really great conference, and we met a ton of cool people - bring on next year!
