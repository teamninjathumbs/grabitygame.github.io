We've just arrived back in New Zealand on the red-eye from Melbourne to Auckland, after exhibiting GRABITY at [PAX Australia](http://aus.paxsite.com/indie) - what a total blast!  Probably one of the most intense weekends of our lives so far. Three days of non-stop gaming, chatting, and yelling - interspersed with moments of panic, and a few beers in the mix as well :)  Met a ton of cool folks, including our 5 PAX Indie Showcase neighbours.  It was extremely humbling to be in the company of these amazing games and fellow devs:

A massive thanks to everyone who turned up at the Grabity booth and played a round or two with us - you guys were awesome! :D

## Preparations

About six weeks out from PAX, we decided that demoing on a laptop was not going to cut it, and 

## Day 0 - Arrival

We arrived in Melbourne late at night after a cramped Jetstar flight and a near-disaster with visas (Mo and his Mum both have German passports, and we didn't realize they needed to obtain travel visas to enter Australia.)  We were also pretty worried about taking our demo rig as carry-on luggage as it's quite heavy, but everything worked out fine in that department, luckily!

## Day 1 - Setup
