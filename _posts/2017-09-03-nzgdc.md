We'll be at [NZGDC 2017](http://www.nz-gdc.com/) in Auckland this week.  If you're attending, come along and say hi - we'll be at the Bean Bag End section demoing on a projector (thanks [Shrek](https://www.facebook.com/astrdiaries/)!).  Steve will also be giving a short talk entitled [Finding the fun in Physics](http://sched.co/Bo8Y), which will be about the way our physics-based character control evolved from barely mobile capsules in the early days to what we have now.  Hope to see you there!
