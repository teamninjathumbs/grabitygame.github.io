## Grabity Post-release Feedback

Grabity, the award winning game from Team Ninja Thumbs which has just been released on Steam, is getting fantastic reviews.

In this fast-paced, physics-based arena brawler, 2-4 players duke it out using gravity guns to turn nearby objects into lethal projectiles or makeshift shields in intense tactical throw-downs.

‘We love all the classic couch multiplayer games and we wanted to deliver that same vibe with online play too,’ said Steve Salmond, the game’s programmer.  

It seems they’ve succeeded.  Players on Steam are raving about it:

> Grabity is a great title. It's an arena brawler with loader mechs. Everything in it is quality, from the graphics to the tutorial, it doesn't miss a beat.

> The developers are committed to making this game the best it can possibly be for the community. They have been listening and working with the community and their feedback, to make what is honestly one of the best brawlers I have played in quite a while.
