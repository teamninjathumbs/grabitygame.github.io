## About
Team Ninja Thumbs is a small independent game studio based in Auckland, New Zealand.   We started off doing game jams, and realized that we both wanted to take on a bigger project together.  Grabity, our first title, started off as a side project but quickly grew into a serious undertaking when we realized we had a really fun prototype on our hands.
