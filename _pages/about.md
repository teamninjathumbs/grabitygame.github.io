Ninja Thumbs is a small independent game studio based in Auckland, New Zealand.   We started off doing game jams, but soon realized that we wanted to take on a bigger project together.  [Grabity](/grabity/) is a side project that quickly grew into a serious undertaking when we realized we had a really fun prototype on our hands.
